# 1. Use architecture decision record

Date 7. February 2019

## Status:

accepted

## Context:

The project needs clarifying conventions

## Decision:

We will use ADR's to establish conventions. The format in which these ADR's are written is based on a template by Michael Nygard (http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)

## Consequences:

There will be documentation about the decisions made in development. This documentation can help developers identify the intentions behind development decisions
